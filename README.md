An autmation script aimed to remove the need to look at different applications just for basic information.

To use, clone the repository. Nacigate to install folder and create a python virtual environment. Activate the <code>venv</code> and then run <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code><br>
After cloning, create a <code>.env</code> file and put in the information required by the API's. <br>
You will need to create API keys for:
<ul>
<li>OpenWeather</li>
<li>NewsAPIv2</li>
<li>OpenCage API</li>

After obtaining the API keys, make sure to put them in your <code>.env</code> file.

Execute within IDE.
I still need to work on the automation part, the idea is to run the script on a raspberry pi or similar.
